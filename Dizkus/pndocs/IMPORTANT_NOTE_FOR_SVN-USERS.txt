IMPORTANT NOTE FOR SVN-USERS:
=============================

Users who installed 3.0 using a SVN-checkout from http://code.zikula.org/dizkus 
before Jan 10, 2008 (to be exact: before rev. 970) will not be able to use the 
FULLTEXT search due to a bug in the installer (for more information see
http://code.zikula.org/dizkus/ticket/86).

You need to execute the following SQL commands in phpmyadmin (or your favorite 
tool for maintaining the database):

ALTER TABLE 'dizkus_topics' ADD FULLTEXT 'topic_title';
ALTER TABLE 'dizkus_posts_text' ADD FULLTEXT 'post_text';

If you don't know how to do this, you shouldn't have used a svn version :-).
There will be no more support from our side.

Upgrades from older version of pnForum are *not* affected by this.

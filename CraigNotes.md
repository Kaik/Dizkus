Craig's Notes
=============

 - The forum last post uses the FIRST post from the last topic
 - Subforum is showing last post of parent, not self
 - Last post links should go direct to post?
 - Main page should show subforums
 - total posts, topics not including subforums
 - it may be better to enforce 'delete' cascade behavior on Topics then change
   the delete routine. This would also affect the topic join routine

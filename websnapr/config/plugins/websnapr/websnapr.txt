WebSnapr plugin for Zikula
Version 1.4

0. What
-------
WebSnapr (http://websnapr.com) lets you capture screenshots of web pages.
This plugin for enables this screenshot as some kind of tooltip when moving
the mouse over an external link. It is supposed to be used with Zikula.

 
1. Who
------
The plugin is based on Link Preview V2 written by Brian MacAllister, see
http://www.frequency-decoder.com/2006/10/25/link-preview-v2/ for more
information.
The PostNuke-integration is (c) 2006 by Landseer / Frank Schummertz 
(frank.schummertz@landseer-stuttgart.de)
The plugin was modified for Zikula by Charlie and Carsten Volmer (herr.vorragend)
A demo is available at http://postnuke-themes.de

2. How
------
Unlike the original Link Preview V2 this solution does not need any changes in the supplied files.

WebSnapr consists of

config/plugins/function.websnapr.php
config/plugins/websnapr/websnapr.txt
config/plugins/websnapr/websnapr.js
config/plugins/websnapr/websnapr.css
images/websnapr/ (containing several images)

Just copy the content of the package to your Zikula-root.

After that, change your theme and add the following line somewhere in your template:
<!--[websnapr]-->

That's it.


Load any page that contains an external link (=not linking to your domain) and you will
see a screenshot of the site behind the link when you move the mouse over it. If there is
no screenshot available, websnapr.com will queue your request and inform you about this.
In this case wait a couple of seconds and reload the page. WebSnapr seems to have problems
frames (yuck...), but they suck anyway....

3. Why
------
It's cool, that is enough reason for this. If you don't like, don't use it.

WebSnapr plugin for Zikula Version 1.1.x
Version 1.3

0. What
-------
WebSnapr (http://websnapr.com) lets you capture screenshots of web pages.
This plugin for enables this screenshot as some kind of tooltip when moving
the mouse over an external link. It is supposed to be used with PostNuke .763
or later, it may also work with older versions, but this is untested.
 
1. Who
------
The plugin is based on Link Preview V2 written by Brian MacAllister, see
http://www.frequency-decoder.com/2006/10/25/link-preview-v2/ for more
information.
The PostNuke-integration is (c) 2006 by Landseer / Frank Schummertz 
(frank.schummertz@landseer-stuttgart.de)
modified for Zikula by Charlie 
A demo is available at http://postnuke-themes.de

2. How
------
Unlike the original Link Preview V2 this solution does not need any changes in the supplied 
files.

WebSnapr consists of

system/pnRender/plugins/function.websnapr.php
system/pnRender/pndocs/websnapr.txt
system/pnRender/pnimages/ (containing several images
system/pnRender/pnjavascript/websnapr.js
system/pnRender/pnstyle/websnapr.js

Copy the content of the supplied pnRender folder to the pnRender folder of
your PostNuke installation.
Change your Xanthia-theme and add
<!--[websnapr]-->
somewhere in the head of the theme. Preferred place is just in front of the </head> tag.
Thats it.

Load any page that contains an external link (=not linking to your domain) and you will
see a screenshot of the site behind the link when you move the mouse over it. If there is
no screenshot available, websnapr.com will queue your request and inform you about this.
In this case wait a couple of seconds and reload the page. WebSnapr seems to have problems
frames (yuck...), but they suck anyway....

3. Why
------
It's cool, that is enough reason for this. If you don't like, don't use it.
If you like it, you can find my Amazon wishlist here:

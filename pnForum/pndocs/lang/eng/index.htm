  Introduction</span></p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'>Thank 
    you for choosing phpBB_14 as your PostNuke forum software. phpBB_14 is based 
    on the phpBB-forum originally created by '<a href="http://www.phpbb.com/" target="_blank">The 
    phpBB Group</a>'. We have added an extensive list of features to phpBB_14 
    that I am sure you will enjoy. phpBB_14 is designed for use as a module with 
    PostNuke, .71x and .72x series. (<a href="http://postnuke.com" target="_blank">http://postnuke.com</a>)</span></p>
  <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"'>We 
    have spent a lot of time on this product and hope that you find it to be as 
    useful as we intended it to be. Support for phpBB_14 can be found at </span><a href="http://pncommunity.de" target="_blank">http://pncommunity.de</a> 
    with a multilingual FAQ area both for Users and Admins and at <a href="http://snowbankih.com" target="_blank">http://snowbankih.com</a> 
    (English only).</p>
  <p class="MsoPlainText">After you have installed pbpBB_14, we encourage you 
    to list your web site in the 'Demo' forum on <a href="http://pncommunity.de" target="_blank">http://pncommunity.de</a> 
    Please mention the language of phpBB_14 on your site, so native speakers can 
    visit it :)<br>

<p class=MsoPlainText><a name="installation"></a>2. Installation</p>
<p>2.1 Requirements</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>phpBB_14 is designed to run as a module under the PostNuke .71x and .72x 
    series. It is assumed that you have the appropriate version of PostNuke already 
    running on your web site.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2.2 Install preparations</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>2.2.1. Please check if this is the latest version available at <a href="http://pncommunity.de" target="_blank">http://pncommunity.de</a> 
    or<a href="http://snowbankih.com" target="_blank"> http://snowbankih.com</a> 
    first. These are the primary support sites for the phpBB_14 module with a 
    multilingual FAQ area both for Users and Admins.</p>
  <p>2.2.2. Make a backup of your PostNuke database (we recommend using phpMyAdmin) 
    and the entire /html/modules/phpBB_14 directory. Then, remove the following 
    directories and files: <br>
    /modules/phpBB_14 <br>
    /includes/search/phpBB_14.php <br>
    /includes/blocks/phpBB_14.php </p>
  <p>This will prevent you from creating potential errors if there were any changes 
    in the filenames or an error in the setup. <br>
    This is a safe proceedure, since all these files will be restored from the
     new distribution and all forum settings are kept in the database.</p>
  <p>Right now we do do not have a script  designed specifically for backing
    up the phpBB-modul related tables in your database. And since backup is a
    good idea
    for all Phoenix
    tables, we suggest the
    
    use of phpMyAdmin. </p>
  <p>Important Notes: <br>
    1. Make sure that you've installed the latest /modules/Modules/pnadminapi.php
      (either from the Security Fix package  direct or from the <a href="http://dev.postnuke.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Downloads&file=index&req=viewsdownload&sid=6">PostNuke
  Developer web site</a>).</p>
  <p>2. Due to some changes in BBCode and Smilie-Handling
  within phpBB_14, you must install and activate three new modules; pn_bbclick,
    pn_bbcode and pn_bbsmile. These files are available in the 'Download' areas
    at <a href="http://pncommunity.de" target="_blank">http://pncommunity.de</a> and
    <a href="http://snowbankih.tzo.com">http://snowbankih.tzo.com</a></p>

<p align="left">2.3. Installation </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><br>
    2.3.1. Extract directories from distribution into the appropriate PostNuke
      Phoenix html directories. 
    <br>
    No files from Phoenix or other modules can be damaged by doing this. <br>
    Do not rename the phpBB_14 module directory. There are hard coded
     links to its name within this directory.<br>
    You can use any names in your forums when creating links in menublocks. </p>
  <p>2.3.2. Go to Phoenix Administration panel,<br>
    enter the Modules section. Press the 'Regenerate' link. <br>
    You should see phpBB_14 in the modules list. <br>
    Press 'Initialize' on the right side of the page. This will create the module's 
    tables and fill in some constants. <br>
    Normally you should get a 'Module initialized' message at the top of the screen. 
    <br>
    Press 'Activate' in phpBB_14 line. <br>
    This will make phpBB_14 Administration panel visible in Phoenix Administration.<br>
    Then,
    do the same 'Initialize' and 'Activate' procedures with the pn_bbcode, pn_bbclick
    and pn_bbsmile modules.<br>
    Now, while still in the Modules section,  the 'Regenerate' or 'List' links.
    To the far right side of the phpBB_14 module listing, you will
    see
    'Deactivate
    | Edit'. Click on 'Edit'. Place a check mark in the three boxes to activate
    pn_bbcode, pn_bbclick and pn_bbsmile. Then save.</p>
  <p>2.3.3. Go to Phoenix Administration panel. <br>
    Select the phpBB_14 link. <br>
    Click on 'Sync forum/topic index'. This will sync the list of users in PostNuke 
    and phpBB_14.<br>
    Click on the 'Forum Wide Options' link .<br>
    Click on 'Restore defaults'. This will set parameters for phpBB_14 </p>
  <p>2.3.4. Go to Administration/Blocks section. <br>
    In the appropriate menu block create a new record for your forum. <br>
    For example 'Forums'. <br>
    Link should be: <br>
    modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=phpBB_14&amp;file=index <br>
    or, <br>
    [phpBB_14] <br>
    Save it. </p>
  <p><a name="235">2.3.5.</a> You're done with the phpBB_14 module installation.<br>
    phpBB_14 is now administrated using the PostNuke Administration panel. <br>
    There you can make general forum settings, define new Categories, Forums, 
    Private Forums, User Rights, User Ranks, Honorary Ranks, re-order categories 
    and forums within them.</p>
  <p>2.3.6 If you have $bgcolor3 and $bgcolor4 as different colors in your theme, 
    then you will get a color change with a 'mouse over' while in the forum index 
    and category views. </p>
  <p>2.3.7 You can create background images for your tables. <br>
    cell1.gif for tableheader and cell2.gif for category (to be placed in /themes/YOUR_THEME/images) 
    Both images must be liimited to 28 pixels in height.</p>
  <p>2.3.8 If you use style sheets in your themes, the styles contained in them 
    will be reflected in phpBB_14. You can also use: pn-phpBB-Title, pn-phpBB-border 
    and pn-phpBB-cat for additional customization of your forums.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><a name="upgrading"></a> 3. Upgrading</p>
<p>3.1. Preparations</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Do preparations as in 2.2.1, 2.2.2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3.2. Upgrading from PN_phpBB_14 versions 1.7.2.1 - 1.7.3.x (PostNuke .71x
  and up)</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Copy new files into place.<br>
    Delete the existing file /includes/blocks/phpBB_14.php<br>
    Go to Admin panel/Modules. Use 'regenerate' link.<br>
    Find phpBB_14 module link and use 'Upgrade' link nearby.<br>
    You will need to 'Activate' the module after the page reloads.<br>
    Delete any old phpBB_14 related blocks you had created and make new ones. <br>
    Then,
     'Initialize' and 'Activate' the three new modules that were installed;
    pn_bbcode, pn_bbclick and pn_bbsmile modules.<br>
Now, while still in the Modules section, the 'Regenerate' or 'List' links. To
the far right side of the phpBB_14 module listing, you will see 'Deactivate |
Edit'. Click on 'Edit'. Place a check mark in the three boxes to activate pn_bbcode,
pn_bbclick and pn_bbsmile. Then save.<br>
    Also
    see <a href="#235">2.3.5</a><br>
    You're done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3.3. Upgrading from PN_phpBB_14 versions 1.7.2.1 - 1.7.2.x (PostNuke .70x)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Due to changes in upgrade procedure between Phoenix releases .70x and .71x, 
    there is no easy and fast way of doing this. <br>
    - write a note with the exact phpBB_14 version that you had previously installed 
    <br>
    - backup your database (see 'Note:' below)<br>
    - backup phpBB_14 tables <br>
    - drop the database tables and erase following folders:<br>
    modules/phpBB_14 <br>
    includes/search/phpBB_14.php <br>
    includes/blocks/phpBB_14.php <br>
    - follow 2.3.1. (only this step)<br>
    - replace this line in pnversion.php <br>
    $modversion['version'] = '1.7.4';<br>
    with <br>
    $modversion['version'] = '1.7.0.0';<br>
    if your previous version were any from 1.7.0.0 to 1.7.0.3<br>
    <br>
    or with:<br>
    $modversion['version'] = '1.7.0.4';<br>
    if your previous version were any from 1.7.0.4 to 1.7.2.0<br>
    - install module as a clean install.<br>
    - drop all phpBB_14 tables<br>
    - restore your initial phpBB_14 tables from backup copy<br>
    - modify pnversion.php with version number you are installing<br>
    - follow 3.2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3.4. Upgrading from forums for PHPNuke 4.4</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> - make a separate backup and drop following tables (be careful!)<br>
    - copy module sources in place as in clean install<br>
    - modify pnversion.php with version number you wrote down before using this 
    table:</p>
  <p><br>
    phpnuke 4.4 forums:<br>
    - install module as a clean install.<br>
    - drop all phpBB_14 tables.<br>
    - restore your initial forum tables you dropped from backup copy.<br>
    - modify pnversion.php with version number of PN_phpBB_14 you are installing.<br>
    - follow 3.2.<br>
  </p>
  <p> Note: Right now there is no script for table backup especially to phpBB-modul 
    related tables. Since backup is a good idea for all Phoenix tables, we suggest 
    the use of phpMyAdmin. 
  </p>

</blockquote>
<p> 4.2 Using PostNuke permissions with the phpBB_14 bulletin board:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> This chapter assumes that you already know Phoenix permissions principles. 
    <br>
    phpBB_14 implements four levels/instances of controlling access rights to 
    the module. <br>
    These are: <br>
    Category <br>
    Forum <br>
    Topic <br>
    StatsBlock <br>
    You are therefore able to control how a user or a user group may use your 
    forum. <br>
    Note: Earlier versions of phpBB_14 had the option of setting a forumtype to 
    be 'private|public'. This option is not used any more. Only Phoenix permissions 
    will be checked when accessed. </p>
  <p>This is also correct regarding moderator access to forums and categories. 
    Moderator access is checked against MODERATE_ACCESS in PostNuke permission 
    system for any given user or group. Setting the moderator parameter inside 
    phpBB_14 administration panel is only for display purposes in forum and category 
    view. The permissions are only defined by the permission system.</p>
  <p>Following are some examples on how to use the PostNuke 0.71x permission system 
    in the phpBB_14 module. We will use these names in the examples to give you 
    a &quot;realworld&quot; examples: <br>
    Category: General <br>
    Forum: Chitchat and discussion <br>
    Usergroup: Mygroup <br>
    User: JimDude </p>
  <p><br>
    EXAMPLE 1. <br>
    Cut off Unregistered users from accessing private forum. Unregistered users 
    will not even see that a private forum exists. <br>
    Go to Administration/Permissions/New group permission </p>
  <p>Group Component Instance Permissions level <br>
    Unregistered phpBB_14::Forum Chitchat:: None </p>
  <p>Because upper lines override lower, the newly created group permission should 
    be above this line: <br>
    Group Component Instance Permissions level <br>
    Unregistered .* .* Read </p>
  <p><br>
    EXAMPLE 2. <br>
    Cut off Unregistered users to a whole category. All forums inside the category 
    will be inaccessible. </p>
  <p>Group Component Instance Permissions level <br>
    Unregistered phpBB_14::Category General:: None </p>
  <p>Because upper lines override lower, the newly created group permission should 
    be above this line: <br>
    Group Component Instance Permissions level <br>
    Unregistered .* .* Read </p>
  <p><br>
    EXAMPLE 3. <br>
    Let Unregistered users view forums in a category, but not post or reply to 
    posts. <br>
    (as the smart eye sees, dropping the following line, will cause unregistered 
    users to have read-access to all categories) </p>
  <p>Group Component Instance Permissions level <br>
    Unregistered phpBB_14::Category General:: Read </p>
  <p>Because upper lines override lower, the newly created group permission should 
    be above this line: <br>
    Group Component Instance Permissions level <br>
    Unregistered .* .* Read </p>
  <p><br>
    EXAMPLE 4. <br>
    Let a closed Usergroup access all forums in a category. All users not in this 
    group fully cut off. </p>
  <p>The first thing to do is to create the Usergroup and populate it with users. 
    (we will not show how to do this here..). </p>
  <p>Group Component Instance Permissions level <br>
    Mygroup phpBB_14::Category General:: Edit <br>
    All groups phpBB_14::Category General:: None </p>
  <p>Because upper lines override lower, the newly created group permissions should 
    be above BOTH of these lines: <br>
    Group Component Instance Permissions level <br>
    Users .* .* Comment <br>
    Unregistered .* .* Read </p>
  <p><br>
    EXAMPLE 5. <br>
    Assign moderator rights to a specific user. This is done in two parts. <br>
    First you have to define the user as a moderator of the forum, using the phpBB_14 
    admin pane. (Note, this is only for viewing purposes in the forums at this 
    time...)<br>
    Next, you have to give the same user moderator rights in the PostNuke <br>
    permission system. This is done using this scheme: </p>
  <p>User Component Instance Permissions level <br>
    JimDude phpBB_14::Forum Chitchat:: Moderate </p>
  <p>NB! Be very careful of using USER permissions. They will always override 
    any group permissions. If you do something wrong, you may end up shutting 
    your self out! Always use other usernames that your ADMIN name, when playing 
    around with user permissions!! </p>
  <p><br>
    EXAMPLE 6. <br>
    Assign a user to be moderator for two forums.<br>
    This is done in two parts. First you assign the user as moderator to both 
    the forums, using the phpBB_14 admin pane. <br>
    Next, you have to give the same user moderator rights in the PostNuke <br>
    permission system. This is done using this scheme: </p>
  <p>User Component Instance Permissions level <br>
    JimDude phpBB_14::Forum (ChitChat|discussion):: Moderate </p>
  <p>Note: <br>
    Be very careful when using USER permissions. They will always override any 
    group permissions. If you do something wrong, you may end up shutting your 
    self out! Always use other usernames than your ADMIN name, when playing around 
    with user permissions!!</p>
  <p>We also suggest looking at the PostNuke permissions documentation :<br>
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/index.php?group_id=27927" target="_blank">http://sourceforge.net/docman/index.php?group_id=27927</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>4.3 Setting up Statistics/Center block </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>You can activate and place these blocks, using standard Phoenix Blocks administrating. 
    <br>
    Create a either a side block or center block of type 'phpBB_14/pnForum Statistics'/'phpBB_14/pnForum Centerblock'.
    Configure it with the PostNuke 'Edit' feature to meet your needs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> 4.4 Setting up Search Include</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The search routine for phpBB_14 is included in the module core and needs 
    no special set-up to be used with PostNuke.</p>

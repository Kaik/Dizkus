New Features
- added 'transform' hooks - this way one can add e.g. autolinks, wiki (bbcode, bbsmile and bbclick hooks available at http://pnforum.de)
- new centerblock
- updated /eng bbcode images (thx to Jim)
- added latest post feature (last week, yesterday, today, 24 hours, x hours, last visit) (thx to timax)

- added config for showing 'Allowed HTML tags' in administration/forumwide settings
- display of bbcode-tags & smiles configurable (can be set to no even if the hooks are installed)
- ip-logging can be turned off (due to privacy issues in germany)

IMPORTANT NOTE:
- since bbcode and smile functions are moved to hooks you'll need the pn_bbcode and pn_bbsmile hooks from http://www.pnforum.de or http://snowbankih.tzo.com
- with pn_bbclick you can convert url- and mail-adresses to links automatically - might be usefull, too ;)
- BBCODES AND SMILIES ARE NOT SHOWN WHEN pn_bbcode and pn_bbsmile ARE NOT INSTALLED & ACTIVE!
